# Album Class and Operations

A Python class `Album` representing music albums and a set of operations to manipulate and manage a collection of albums.

## Description

The `Album` class allows you to represent music albums, including their name, artist, and number of songs. It provides getter and setter methods for each attribute with input validation to ensure the data's correctness. The class also implements a `__str__` method for easy printing.

The provided operations include printing album lists, sorting albums by the number of songs, swapping albums, searching for albums by name, and adding new albums to the collection.
